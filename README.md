# Is mod fully mirrored the canon?
No. Not all objects had been added in mod. But don't worry, i added ink.
Fairly much content I created by myself, such as anti-ink and Massive Searchers Farm (I had to do this block 'cause Mindustry don't allows to drop items after entity death, like in Minecraft).

# How i made that multicraft block?
I used [MultiLib](https://github.com/liplum/MultiCrafterLib) created by Liplum.
